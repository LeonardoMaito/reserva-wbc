# wbc-reservation

## Description

This project was developed as a challenge for **WBC Sistemas**. The chosen challenge was:

> **Create a barbecue grill reservation system, allowing users to view available grills in real-time and make reservations quickly and efficiently.**

## Installation & Versions

### Versions

Two versions were created for this project: **a basic version** and **a more complex version**. Both meet the challenge's requirements.

- The **basic version** is available in the `main` branch.  
- The **more complex version** is available in the `v2` branch. This version includes reservation insertion and removal methods.  

Both versions were developed using **SQLite**, following the **Repository design pattern**, along with **Provider** for state management. The main difference is that the **v2 version integrates some backend functions into the UI**, but both versions include a basic **CRUD** implemented in the backend.
